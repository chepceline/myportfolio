                <h3>About Me</h3>
                I am an apiring digital designer and developer.</p>
                <p>I am currently pursuing an undergraduate course on
            Innovation Technology Management at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology </p>
            <p> I decided to take the course in programming to learn new skills. Being an innovator has made me realize that programming can be a big part to come up with new ideas and implement them and this made me ttake the course.
Programming and coding also sounds fun and also wanted to have fun as I learn the new skills. </p>
<p> Hobbies: l love crocheting and coming up with new patterns of crotchet ideas.</p>
<p>Interests: I love to challenge myself in learning new skill especially in programming and being a developer.</p>
